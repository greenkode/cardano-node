# Demo Programs

There are two demo programs, `demo-forwarder-mux` and `demo-acceptor-mux`. You can run these programs in different terminals and see an interaction between them.

These demo-programs use two libraries: `trace-forward` and `ekg-forward`. The purpose of these demo-programs is demonstration of `Mux`-ing of two `typed-protocol`s.
